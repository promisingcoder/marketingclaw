MarketingClaw core is written in TypeScript. **Node is the recommended runtime**.
Bun is not recommended for the Gateway — known issues with WhatsApp and
Telegram channels; see [Bun (experimental)](/install/bun) for details.

Companion apps exist for Windows Hub, macOS (menu bar app), and mobile nodes
(iOS/Android). Linux companion apps are planned, but the Gateway is fully
supported today. On Windows, choose Windows Hub for the desktop app, native
PowerShell install for terminal-first use, or WSL2 for the most
Linux-compatible Gateway runtime.

- Install guide: [Getting Started](/start/getting-started)
- Windows Hub: [Windows](/platforms/windows)
- Gateway runbook: [Gateway](/gateway)
- Gateway configuration: [Configuration](/gateway/configuration)
- Service status: `marketingclaw gateway status`

## Gateway service install (CLI)

Use one of these (all supported):

- Wizard (recommended): `marketingclaw onboard --install-daemon`
- Direct: `marketingclaw gateway install`
- Configure flow: `marketingclaw configure` → select **Gateway service**
- Repair/migrate: `marketingclaw doctor` (offers to install or fix the service)

The service target depends on OS:

- macOS: LaunchAgent (`ai.marketingclaw.gateway`, or `ai.marketingclaw.<profile>` for a named profile)
- Linux/WSL2: systemd user service (`marketingclaw-gateway[-<profile>].service`)
- Native Windows: Scheduled Task (`MarketingClaw Gateway` or `MarketingClaw Gateway (<profile>)`), with a per-user Startup-folder login item fallback if task creation is denied
