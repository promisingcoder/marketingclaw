Debugging helpers for streaming output, gateway iteration, and startup profiling.

## Runtime debug overrides

`/debug` sets **runtime-only** config overrides (memory, not disk). Disabled by default; enable with `commands.debug: true`.

```text
/debug show
/debug set messages.responsePrefix="[marketingclaw]"
/debug unset messages.responsePrefix
/debug reset
```

`/debug reset` clears all overrides and returns to the on-disk config.

## Session trace output

`/trace` shows plugin-owned trace/debug lines for one session without enabling full verbose mode. Use it for plugin diagnostics such as Active Memory debug summaries; use `/verbose` for normal status/tool output.

```text
/trace
/trace on
/trace off
```

## Plugin lifecycle trace

Set `MARKETINGCLAW_PLUGIN_LIFECYCLE_TRACE=1` for a phase-by-phase breakdown of plugin metadata, discovery, registry, runtime mirror, config mutation, and refresh work. Writes to stderr, so JSON command output stays parseable.

```bash
MARKETINGCLAW_PLUGIN_LIFECYCLE_TRACE=1 marketingclaw plugins install tokenjuice --force
```

```text
[plugins:lifecycle] phase="config read" ms=6.83 status=ok command="install"
[plugins:lifecycle] phase="slot selection" ms=94.31 status=ok command="install" pluginId="tokenjuice"
[plugins:lifecycle] phase="registry refresh" ms=51.56 status=ok command="install" reason="source-changed"
```

Use this before reaching for a CPU profiler. From a source checkout, measure the built runtime with `node dist/entry.js ...` after `pnpm build`; `pnpm marketingclaw ...` also measures source-runner overhead.

## CLI startup and command profiling

Checked-in startup benchmarks:

```bash
pnpm test:startup:bench:smoke
pnpm tsx scripts/bench-cli-startup.ts --preset real --case status --runs 3
pnpm tsx scripts/bench-cli-startup.ts --preset real --cpu-prof-dir .artifacts/cli-cpu
```

For one-off profiling through the normal source runner, set `MARKETINGCLAW_RUN_NODE_CPU_PROF_DIR`:

```bash
MARKETINGCLAW_RUN_NODE_CPU_PROF_DIR=.artifacts/cli-cpu pnpm marketingclaw status
```

The source runner adds Node CPU profile flags and writes a `.cpuprofile` for the command. Use this before adding temporary instrumentation to command code.

For startup stalls that look like synchronous filesystem or module-loader work, add Node's sync I/O trace flag through the source runner:

```bash
MARKETINGCLAW_TRACE_SYNC_IO=1 pnpm marketingclaw gateway --force
```

`pnpm gateway:watch` leaves this flag disabled by default for the watched Gateway child; set `MARKETINGCLAW_TRACE_SYNC_IO=1` when you want sync I/O trace output in watch mode too.

## Gateway watch mode

```bash
pnpm gateway:watch
```

By default this starts or restarts a tmux session named `marketingclaw-gateway-watch-<profile>` (for example `marketingclaw-gateway-watch-main`), with a port suffix such as `marketingclaw-gateway-watch-dev-19001` added only when `MARKETINGCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT` differs from the default port `18789`. It auto-attaches from interactive terminals; non-interactive shells, CI, and agent exec calls stay detached and print attach instructions instead:

```bash
tmux attach -t marketingclaw-gateway-watch-main
```

The tmux pane runs the raw watcher:

```bash
node scripts/watch-node.mjs gateway --force
```

Foreground mode without tmux:

```bash
pnpm gateway:watch:raw
# or
MARKETINGCLAW_GATEWAY_WATCH_TMUX=0 pnpm gateway:watch
```

Keep tmux management but disable auto-attach:

```bash
MARKETINGCLAW_GATEWAY_WATCH_ATTACH=0 pnpm gateway:watch
```

Profile watched Gateway CPU time when debugging startup/runtime hotspots:

```bash
pnpm gateway:watch --benchmark
```

The watch wrapper consumes `--benchmark` before invoking the Gateway and writes one V8 `.cpuprofile` per Gateway child exit under `.artifacts/gateway-watch-profiles/`. Stop or restart the watched gateway to flush the current profile, then open it with Chrome DevTools or Speedscope:

```bash
npx speedscope .artifacts/gateway-watch-profiles/*.cpuprofile
```

- `--benchmark-dir <path>`: write profiles somewhere else.
- `--benchmark-no-force`: skip the default `--force` port cleanup and fail fast if the Gateway port is already in use.

Benchmark mode suppresses sync-I/O trace spam by default. Set `MARKETINGCLAW_TRACE_SYNC_IO=1` with `--benchmark` to get both CPU profiles and sync-I/O stack traces; in benchmark mode those trace blocks go to `gateway-watch-output.log` under the benchmark directory (filtered from the terminal pane), while normal Gateway logs stay visible.

The tmux wrapper carries common non-secret runtime selectors into the pane, including `MARKETINGCLAW_PROFILE`, `MARKETINGCLAW_CONFIG_PATH`, `MARKETINGCLAW_STATE_DIR`, `MARKETINGCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT`, and `MARKETINGCLAW_SKIP_CHANNELS`. Put provider credentials in your normal profile/config, or use raw foreground mode for one-off ephemeral secrets.

If the watched Gateway exits during startup, the watcher runs `marketingclaw doctor --fix --non-interactive` once and restarts the Gateway child. Set `MARKETINGCLAW_GATEWAY_WATCH_AUTO_DOCTOR=0` to see the original startup failure without the dev-only repair pass.

The managed tmux pane defaults to colored Gateway logs; set `FORCE_COLOR=0` when starting `pnpm gateway:watch` to disable ANSI output.

The watcher restarts on build-relevant files under `src/`, extension source files, extension `package.json` and `marketingclaw.plugin.json` metadata, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, and `tsdown.config.ts`. Extension metadata changes restart the gateway without forcing a rebuild; source and config changes still rebuild `dist` first.

Add gateway CLI flags after `gateway:watch` and they pass through on each restart. Re-running the same watch command respawns the named tmux pane; the raw watcher keeps a single-watcher lock so duplicate watcher parents are replaced instead of piling up.

## Dev profile + dev gateway (--dev)

Two **separate** `--dev` flags:

- **Global `--dev` (profile):** isolates state under `~/.marketingclaw-dev` and defaults the gateway port to `19001` (derived ports shift with it).
- **`gateway --dev`:** tells the Gateway to auto-create a default config + workspace when missing (and skip bootstrap).

Recommended flow (dev profile + dev bootstrap):

```bash
pnpm gateway:dev
MARKETINGCLAW_PROFILE=dev marketingclaw tui
```

Without a global install, run the CLI via `pnpm marketingclaw ...`.

What this does:

1. **Profile isolation** (global `--dev`)
   - `MARKETINGCLAW_PROFILE=dev`
   - `MARKETINGCLAW_STATE_DIR=~/.marketingclaw-dev`
   - `MARKETINGCLAW_CONFIG_PATH=~/.marketingclaw-dev/marketingclaw.json`
   - `MARKETINGCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT=19001` (browser/canvas ports shift accordingly)

2. **Dev bootstrap** (`gateway --dev`)
   - Writes a minimal config if missing (`gateway.mode=local`, bind loopback).
   - Sets `agents.defaults.workspace` to the dev workspace and `agents.defaults.skipBootstrap=true`.
   - Seeds the workspace files if missing: `AGENTS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `TOOLS.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`.
   - Default identity: **C3-PO** (protocol droid).
   - `pnpm gateway:dev` also sets `MARKETINGCLAW_SKIP_CHANNELS=1` to skip channel providers.

Reset flow (fresh start):

```bash
pnpm gateway:dev:reset
```

<Note>
`--dev` is a **global** profile flag and gets eaten by some runners. If you need to spell it out, use the env var form:

```bash
MARKETINGCLAW_PROFILE=dev marketingclaw gateway --dev --reset
```

</Note>

`--reset` wipes config, credentials, sessions, and the dev workspace (moved to trash, not deleted), then recreates the default dev setup.

<Tip>
If a non-dev gateway is already running (launchd or systemd), stop it first:

```bash
marketingclaw gateway stop
```

</Tip>

## Raw stream logging

MarketingClaw can log the **raw assistant stream** before any filtering/formatting. This is the best way to see whether reasoning is arriving as plain text deltas (or as separate thinking blocks).

Enable it via CLI:

```bash
pnpm gateway:watch --raw-stream
```

Optional path override:

```bash
pnpm gateway:watch --raw-stream --raw-stream-path ~/.marketingclaw/logs/raw-stream.jsonl
```

Equivalent env vars:

```bash
MARKETINGCLAW_RAW_STREAM=1
MARKETINGCLAW_RAW_STREAM_PATH=~/.marketingclaw/logs/raw-stream.jsonl
```

Default file: `~/.marketingclaw/logs/raw-stream.jsonl`

## Safety notes

- Raw stream logs can include full prompts, tool output, and user data.
- Keep logs local and delete them after debugging.
- If you share logs, scrub secrets and PII first.

## Debugging in VSCode

Source maps are required because the build hashes generated filenames. The included `launch.json` targets the Gateway service:

1. **Rebuild and Debug Gateway** - deletes `/dist` and rebuilds with debugging enabled before starting the Gateway.
2. **Debug Gateway** - debugs an existing build without touching `/dist`.

### Setup

1. Open **Run and Debug** (Activity Bar, or `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`D`).
2. Select **Rebuild and Debug Gateway** and press **Start Debugging**.

To manage the build/debug cycle manually instead:

1. Enable source maps in a terminal:
   - **Linux/macOS**: `export OUTPUT_SOURCE_MAPS=1`
   - **Windows (PowerShell)**: `$env:OUTPUT_SOURCE_MAPS="1"`
   - **Windows (CMD)**: `set OUTPUT_SOURCE_MAPS=1`
2. Rebuild: `pnpm clean:dist && pnpm build`
3. Select **Debug Gateway** and press **Start Debugging**.

Set breakpoints in `src/` TypeScript files; the debugger maps them to compiled JavaScript via source maps.

### Notes

- **Rebuild and Debug Gateway** deletes `/dist` and runs a full `pnpm build` with source maps on every launch.
- **Debug Gateway** can start/stop without affecting `/dist`, but you manage the build cycle in a separate terminal.
- Edit `launch.json` `args` to debug other CLI subcommands.
- To use the built CLI for other tasks (for example `dashboard --no-open` if your debug session spawns a new auth token), run it from another terminal: `node ./marketingclaw.mjs` or an alias like `alias marketingclaw-build="node $(pwd)/marketingclaw.mjs"`.
